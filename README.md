Java-based LeetCode + DSA solutions with tests.

## Structure
- `src/main/java/...`: Java solutions
- `src/test/java/...`: JUnit tests
- `common`: shared data structures (ListNode, TreeNode)
- `interfaces`: reusable interfaces
- `notes`: problem patterns & notes
- CI: runs tests on every push

## Goals
- Improve problem solving
- Build reusable Java code
- Practice TDD with JUnit
